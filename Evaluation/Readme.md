## ðŸ“Š Evaluation

This folder contains scripts for overall quantitative evaluations of the models.
These evaluations are conducted at both the attenuation map (Î¼Map) level and the reconstructed PET image level using the estimated attenuation maps.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `Statistics/`  
  Contains scripts to compute overall statistics on estimated Î¼Maps generated by the models.  

- `PET_Evaluation/`  
  Contains scripts to evaluate PET reconstructions that were attenuation corrected using the predicted uMaps with our model.
