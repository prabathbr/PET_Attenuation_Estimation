## 📊 Evaluation

This folder contains scripts for overall quantitative evaluations of the models.
These evaluations are conducted at both the attenuation map (μMap) level and the reconstructed PET image level using the estimated attenuation maps.

## 📂 Contents

- `Statistics/`  
  Contains scripts to compute overall statistics on estimated μMaps generated by the models.  

- `PET_Evaluation/`  
  Contains scripts to evaluate PET reconstructions that were attenuation corrected using the predicted μMaps with our model.
